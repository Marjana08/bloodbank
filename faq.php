			<p>About Blood Donation:</p>
			<h2>Q. What is blood? How much blood does a human body contain? </h2><br>
			<h2>A. Blood is the red colored fluid flowing continuously in the human body’s circulatory system, on an average, a human being has about 5-6 liters of blood flowing in the body. About 7%of the body weight of a healthy individual is accounted for by blood.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Q. What is the composition of blood?</p>
			<br>
			<h2>. Blood mainly contains a fluid called plasma which has three types of cells – Red Blood Cells or RBC’s, White Blood Cells or WBC’s and plate lets. Plasma acts as a vehicle to carry nutrition including protein, glucose, enzymes, and hormones etc; Red blood cells carry oxygen from the lungs to various body tissues; White blood cells help the immune system of the body and platelets facilitate the process of clotting and coagulation of blood.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Q. What is Blood formed?</p>
			<br>
			<h2> The RBC, granulocytes of WBC and platelets are produced mainly by bone marrow. The lymphocytes and monocytes are formed in the lymphoid and reticulo-endothelial tissues. The orderly proliferation of the cells in the bone marrow and their release into the circulatory system is carefully regulated according to the needs of the body. Every day, new blood cells are produced in the bone marrow and every day old cells die and are removed from the body.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Q. What is the natural life of blood cells?</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Red blood cells have a life of about 120 days, white blood cells live for a few days and platelets for a few hours. The addition of new cells and removal of old cells is a continuous process.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Q. What is haemoglobin?</p>
			<br>
			<h2>Haemoglobin is a substance present in the red blood cells. It helps in carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide to different parts of the body. On an average, the haemoglobin level for a healthy male should be between 14-16 gm % and for a female between 12-­14 gm %.</h2>
			<br>
			<p>Q. What is the importance of knowing the blood groups?</p>
			<br>
			<h2>For all practical and routine purposes, it is ideal to transfuse to the patient the same group of blood which he/she belongs to. Under no circumstances can an 0 group person get any other blood except O. Similarly, an A group patient cannot be given B group blood and vice versa. It is only in a dire emergency that we take 0 group as a universal donor and AB groups as universal recipient.</h2>
